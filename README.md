Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of developing, testing and maintaining  software solutions. It  is important in that it solves real-world problems through technology. It also helps technology improve though testing and advancements.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of Software Engineering NATO Software Engineering Conference 1968- Due to the high costs of software development, the need for better software development practices was recognized.
The rise of Object-Oriented Programming 1980s and 1990'S - Before the 80's software was mainly procedural, the need for modular, maintainable and reusable code was recognized leading the development of languages such as Java and Python became popular improving software design.
The Agile Revolution- Started in 2001- present - Methodologies such as agile and waterfall have gained traction. They aim to foster collaboration and flexibility. These new methodologies have improved how software teams work supporting improved feedback mechanisms, faster program cycles, and better adaptability of software programs to the everchanging demands. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requiremenets analysis - This is the stage where an engineer understands the requirement sof the task at hand . Including the problem he/she seeks to solve and wether it is feasible to solve the mentioned problem. 
Planning- This is the second step where a software engineers determines the resources they would need to effectively deliver on the said project. In this phase the sofware engineer looks at aspects such as the budget, The risks and the roadmap of execution. 
Design- Creating the architechture and infrastructure neccesary for the coding 
Coding - writing the code
Testing - Testing  the code to identify bugs and debugging to make it ready for deployment 
Deployment - Releasing the software for use 
Maintenance - Fixing bugs, adding better features and monitoring the system to ensure it works well.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodoly is better suited for projects with well defined requirements and very minimal changes needed following implementation for example  banking systems. Agile methodoloy is better suited for dynamic and ever changing projects  for example mobile applications. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications. They take project requirements and transform them into functional programs using programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript. Their work involves writing clean, efficient code, debugging issues, and continuously improving the softwareâ€™s performance. Developers collaborate closely with designers, testers, and other team members to ensure the final product meets user needs and technical specifications.

A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures that the software is reliable, functional, and free of critical defects before it is deployed. They design and execute test cases, both manually and through automated testing tools, to identify bugs and performance issues. QA engineers work closely with developers to report and resolve problems, ensuring that the software meets industry standards for security, usability, and efficiency. Their role is crucial in maintaining a high-quality user experience and preventing costly errors post-deployment.

The Project Manager (PM) oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to business goals. They plan and manage project timelines, allocate resources, and coordinate communication between stakeholders, developers, and testers. Project managers identify risks early, propose solutions, and keep the team aligned with the project's objectives. Their leadership ensures that software development runs smoothly and efficiently, balancing technical requirements with business priorities.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing demands, Budget constraints, Evolving nature of software engineering. Software engineers should lern entreprenuership skills to learn how to plan nd budget , They should aslo learn how to communiate the scope of the project  and lastly they should always keep up with changing trends and skills in the  field. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing every individual component to ensure it is working as should
Intergration testing - Testing the different componenets work together 
System Testing -Ensures the software meets the technical and functional requirements of the system. By ensuring all the componenets in the sytem work together effortlessly 
Acceptance- Ensures the system solves the problem identified in the analysis stage . Is tested on the user end following the completion of the project. 

All these types of testing are important in monitoring and evaluating the syems being created as  it is developed. This helps mitigate errors that can be costly to fix post deployment . 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of refining the prompts issued to AI to improve the quality of results AI issues one.  It is importance for persons to learn better prompt tactics like specifying their prompts in order for AI to give them better results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Software development Technological advancement challenges 
Identify some of the main challenges in technological advancements in software development, give examples and i dentify some of the solutions that Software developers can use to avert these challenges.
